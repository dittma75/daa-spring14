# daa-spring14
This is my set of class projects for Design and Analysis of Algorithms.  Unfortunately,
Netbeans attributed all of my GitHub commits to "Kevin-PC", which is a username that belongs
to Crepuscle.  I don't know why it didn't use my username, which I had provided, but all of
those commits are really mine.  Note that he has no activity for this project at all, and
he doesn't even have any GitHub activity for the Spring of 2014.
