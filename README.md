This is my set of class projects for Design and Analysis of Algorithms.  Unfortunately,
Netbeans attributed all of my GitHub commits to "Kevin-PC", which is a username that belongs
to Crepuscle.  I don't know why it didn't use my username, which I had provided, but all of
those commits are really mine.
